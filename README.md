#Machine Learning Somethings
##These are my experiments and failures in my introduction to machine learning algorithms
Something may come out of this like a few cool tools, experiments and coding libraries.

I have tried many programming languages and libraries for ML with very limited success (mostly non-existent).

Most the code will be depricated in favour of a working codeset in the future. I may just make a new repo.

##NetAndCuda
This is where my experiments with .Net and Cuda exist.
My hope is to make stuff OS independent as I use both Linux and Windows on a daily basis.
Unfortunately my access to Cuda at the moment in on a Windows system and Visual Studio is the easiest to get off the ground with Cuda.

I have made a commandline application in C# called ImageProcessor (should be preprocessor), this is the tool which will first process my image datasets,
for some machine learning experiments.
I want to release this tool as something useful in the future, its still a work in progress and has many TODOs.

##TODOS:
#ImageProcessor:
	- perhaps clustering for images
	- feature detection
	- direct memory interfacing so no need for using hdd if you dont want to
	- GUI
	- tons of bug fixes
	- make the code cleaner
	- get rid of the todos which litter the code base
	- move actual algorithm to class library so it can be seamlessly integrated into future projects
	- Add abilit to remove only one channel of colour
